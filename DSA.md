* Arrays:
  * (*Operations*) Insertion
  * (*Operations*) Deletion
* Linked Lists:
  * (*Operations*) Insertion:
  * (*Operations*) Deletion:
  * Linked List vs Arrays:
  * Find nth element from the end:
    - Trick: Use two pointers - front & back. Increment front pointer by n and then keep incrementing both pointers together till front pointer reaches null. At this point the location the back pointer points to is the nth element.
    - [Code] TODO
  * Find if there is a loop in linked list:
    - Trick: Use two pointers - fast and slow. Increment fast pointer by 2 and slow pointer by 1 and if the two pointers meet then there exists a loop in the linked list.
    - [Code] TODO
  *
* Stack: Stack is a LIFO data structure. The item which is pushed first into the stack gets popped in the end.
  * (*Operations*) Push
  * (*Operations*) Pop
  * (*Operations*) Top
  * (*Operations*) empty:

* Queue:
  * Priority Queue:
* Trees:
  * Binary Tree:
  * Binary Search Tree:
  * (Advanced) AVL Tree:
  * (Advanced) Red Black Tree:
  * (Advanced) B Tree:
* Heap:
* Hash table:
* Graphs:
