Basics:
* What is static keyword?
* Keywords: [const] [volatile] [enum] [explicit] [extern] [inline] [mutable] [namespace]
* Difference between struct and union?
* What is memory leak?
* Stack vs Heap?
* What is a dangling pointer?
* What would happen if you read from a pointer/location you are not supposed to read?
